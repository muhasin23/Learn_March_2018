# Here's somee new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

# declaring variable days and assigns a string
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# declaring variable months and assigns string with new line
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# prints the days
puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
# prints the months
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

# prints a quote 
puts %q{
  There's something going on here.
  With this weird quote
  We'll be able to type as much as we like.
  Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
